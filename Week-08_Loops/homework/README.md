## Do
Now we need to go back and practice some DOM manipulation with JavaScript. The idea is to use the powers of loops and arrays to build our website from the [menu-database.js](./menu-database.js) database. The pseudocode for this task would look something like:

- Only write a `<ul>` element in your HTML document with an id
- Get the `<ul>` element using getElementById
- Use any type of the for loops you think might work to loop through the database.
- In each iteration create a `<li>` element
- Create an `<img>` element for the product image, and 3 `<p>` elements for product name, price and category (using createElement).
- Attach these 4 elements to the `<li>` created before
- Attach the `<li>` to the `<ul>` element
- Create a ‘vegetarian’ and ‘meat’ button that filters the products on the page.

To submit, create a new repository in your own account by Sunday 18:00 and send the link to your assigned teacher via Slack. We will send out the assignments.
