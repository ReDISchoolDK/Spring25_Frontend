# Homework Week 6

## Do
Let’s improve our counter!

- Disable the ‘-’ button whenever the counter reaches 0 (keep in mind that it only should be disabled if the counter is on 0)
- Add a span element saying “You have free shipping” whenever the counter is at 10 or greater
- Change the ‘+’ button’s background to red whenever the counter reaches 20 or greater

### Bonus
- Remove the Free shipping span whenever the counter goes down to 9 again, or if it reaches 20
- Additionally, whenever it reaches 20, add a span saying “Out of stock” and disable the + button

Update your repo by Sunday 18:00 and send the link to your assigned teacher via Slack. We will send out the assignments.
