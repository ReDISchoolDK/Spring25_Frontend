# Homework Week 6

Submit your exercise by creating a Pull Request. You can just copy your files into this folder.

## Do
Let’s improve our counter

Disable the ‘-’ button whenever the counter reaches 0 (keep in mind that it only should be disabled if the counter is on 0)
Add a span element saying “You have free shipping” whenever the counter reaches 10 

Change the ‘+’ button’s background to red whenever the counter reaches 20

### Bonus
Remove the Free shipping span whenever the counter reaches 9, or if it reaches 20
Additionally, whenever it reaches 20, add a span saying “Out of stock”

Create your Pull Request by Sunday 18:00 and send the link to your assigned teacher via Slack. We will send out the assignments.
